    I think I understand the basic concepts of styles, but trying to get them right has been a pain in the ***.
    The setting of styles below has been performed after a lengthy trial and error with frequent visits
    to the Sunshine App videos and general googling.

    Atm. it is near what I wanted, but why the h*** my Settings Activity got an icon on top is beyond my understanding.

    <!-- Base application theme -->
    <style name="AppTheme" parent="@style/Theme.AppCompat" />

    <!-- Settings theme -->
    <style name="SettingsTheme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Holo">
        <item name="android:actionBarStyle">@style/MyActionBar</item>
    </style>

    <style name="MyActionBar" parent="@android:style/Widget.Holo.ActionBar">
        <item name="android:displayOptions">showHome|homeAsUp|showTitle</item>
    </style>
